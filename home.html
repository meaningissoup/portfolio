            I’m currently a second-year physics student with a deep fascination for the quantum world and a passion for unraveling the complex mathematics that govern it. Alongside physics, I’m equally enthusiastic about computer science, and computational physics, and am a firm believer in the importance of AI in the future of science. I focus on creating intuitive tools that help simplify and enhance the understanding of physical concepts in an engaging way. Through my projects, I aim to make learning more accessible.

            As an autistic student and proud disability advocate, I’m passionate about promoting inclusivity and neurodiversity. In my first year of college, I was elected to be the Chair of the <a href="https://trinitynews.ie/2024/03/trinity-musical-theatre-lands-top-awards-at-csc-society-of-the-year-awards-2/">award-winning</a> Neurodiversity Society, where I led efforts that resulted in its official recognition by Trinity College Dublin. I’m driven by a desire to create spaces where everyone, regardless of background, ability, or neurotype, can learn and succeed. This desire majourly impacts the projects I choose to take on, focusing greatly on intuitive learning methods and new ways of conceptualising physical concepts that don't necessarily adhere to the traditional schooling system.
